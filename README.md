# github pages

This is just a small site about me I hope to use as a living resume and portfolio. Hopefully I can incorporate some of my projects or at least figure out good ways to document them here.

Thanks for checking me out

# Wait, why static?

Yes I can web dev, but still not every site needs to be a SPA or PWA. This is a small site trying to convey some info about me and that seems like a perfect use case for a static site to me.

And while I'm here, I don't mind the github.io url bc it comes with the price of free.

    <h3>The Right Tool for the Job</h3>
    <small>Originally posted some thoughts about this on my <a
        href='https://www.linkedin.com/in/grantmatejka/'>LinkedIn</a></small>
    <p>
      As I've grown as a software engineer, I can't help but feel like there's this nagging pressure by the industry at
      large to utilize the new hottest technology, when frankly, it may not be necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      I may be totally wrong on this, but I don't think software is an ndustry of trends. Clearly,
      trends affect the lives of developers heavily, but I can't think of many instances of trends
      that have truly changed the way we write software. UML used to be considered a lot more 'useful' than
      today. I'm sure kanban is going to overrated someday (tomorrow??). Certainly the Unix philosophy birthed
      microservice architectures, but even a movement this influential and old hasn't demanded adoption from all of us.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not to say that these trends or technologies are evil. This isn't to say that these trends are even bad.
      Actually, a lot of these trends are quite cool and useful and innovative, but each trend is only useful in its respective 
      domain. Not everything is destined to be fulfilled by the latest buzzwords marketing found on google.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently read Martin Fowler's piece called Monolith First which provides some pretty convincing reasons to take
      the more 'boring' architectural approach first rather the blindly jumping into buzzword promoted microservice
      architecture.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was also just listening to the Angel podcast episode with Mark Cuban and host Jason Calacanis. Mr. Cuban said
      that companies need to stop acting like they have to include some AI in their product and should just stick to their
      google sheets or excel with some basic machine learning algorithms. Hearing someone say not to use AI was such a relief,
      as I feel like too often developers are convinced to invest in trends rather than results.
    </p>
    <p>
      I feel a need to promote the use of the right tool for the job. We can't be getting caught up with recent trends
      or buzzwords, but rather we need to get caught up with doing our jobs well. Not every app needs AI, not every project
      should be split into microservices, but rather every product is unique and its my job as a developer to find the
      tools needed (and that's what makes being a developer so fun).
    </p>
    <p>
      As stated above, these things aren't bad. There are use cases for most (if not all) the different technologies we 
      have today, but not every projecct demands every technology. That would be absurd. As developers, engineers and professionals
      we need to discern what is needed where. Why is something needed? What are the drawbacks? How does this scale? 
      What does maintainability look like?
    </p>
    <p>
      Asking and answering these questions is what differentiates a programmer from a software engineer. I love programming.
      I program on the weekends. However, when I'm on the clock I'm an engineer, and that's a lot of fun too.

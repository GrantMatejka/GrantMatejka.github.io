    <h3>San Luis Obispo, California · (661) 808-8874 · grantmatejka1@gmail.com </h3>
    <p>My education, professional experience and personal interest has lead me to experiment with and develop skills in
      anything from Algorithms to Data structures to Full Stack Web Development to Game Design/Development and so much
      more.
      Utilizing knowledge of numerous Programming Languages (Java, JavaScript, C#, C++, C, ...) and Frameworks (React
      Native, ASP.NET Core 3.0, Blazor, ...) I have had a thrill exploring and growing in the field of Software
      Development.
      My coding experience that isn't able to be described fully here is available on my GitHub, including numerous
      projects and experiments. For insight into my work experience please refer to my LinkedIn or download my resume.
    </p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
      Software Developer Intern
      The Parable Group
      Utilizing Blazor, "a framework for building interactive client-side web UI with .NET" (docs.microsoft.com), I am
      responsible for writing efficient, high quality code for The Parable Group's web product, Parable Connect. My
      responsibilities also include researching new technologies, furthering development on individual side projects and
      performing any other various tasks that may be requested of me. Side projects also necessitate utilizing mapping
      api's, developing location based services and full stack web development. Majority of work is done utilizing
      Microsoft suite of tools and ASP.NET Core 3, especially Blazor, and requires understanding of big data structure,
      value and utility.

    <p>
      When I'm not coding I enjoy reading books of all genres. Some topics I specifically enjoy to read about are
      religious studies, ancient Greece, programming and classics. If reading takes too much energy I usually move over
      to
      playing videogames.
      After a long day of work I enjoy going outside for a nice walk or taking care of my small garden. Living in San
      Luis
      Obispo the weather is almost always nice and beautiful hikes are only a short drive away.
